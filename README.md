# Kaggle API
## API credentials

To use the Kaggle API, sign up for a Kaggle account at https://www.kaggle.com. Then go to the 'Account' tab of your user profile (`https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account`) and select 'Create API Token'. This will trigger the download of `kaggle.json`, a file containing your API credentials. Place this file in the location `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (on Windows in the location `C:\Users\<Windows-username>\.kaggle\kaggle.json` - you can check the exact location, sans drive, with `echo %HOMEPATH%`). You can define a shell environment variable `KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR` to change this location to `$KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR/kaggle.json` (on Windows it will be `%KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR%\kaggle.json`).

For your security, ensure that other users of your computer do not have read access to your credentials. On Unix-based systems you can do this with the following command: 

`chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`

You can also choose to export your Kaggle username and token to the environment:

```bash
export KAGGLE_USERNAME=datadinosaur
export KAGGLE_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
In addition, you can export any other configuration value that normally would be in
the `$HOME/.kaggle/kaggle.json` in the format 'KAGGLE_<VARIABLE>' (note uppercase).  
For example, if the file had the variable "proxy" you would export `KAGGLE_PROXY`
and it would be discovered by the client.

# Installation

 1. cd to the directory where requirements.txt is located.
 2. activate your virtualenv
 3. run the following code in your shell to install all the libraries necessary for the application.  
 
```python
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

To see the dashbaord, run the following code in your shell:

1. Change directories to the inner main dash application
 ```python
cd dash
 ```

2. Run migrations
 ```python

## Technology Stack
In this analysis, we used python as the primary programming language because of its rich palette of tools that make data analysis a cinch. Some of the packages we used are
| Library | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) | Matplotlib is an extremely versatile library of tools for generating interactive plots that are easy to interpret and customise. |
| [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) | Numpy is a popular library used for array manipulation and vector operations. It is used extensively across python projects that require scientific computing. |
| [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) | Pamdas is another library for data science that is just as popular as numpy. It provides easy to use data structures and functions to manipulate structured data. |
| [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) | Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. |
| [Sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) | Sqlite3 is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. |

## Data Cleaning

The most important step to take before we get started geenrating any kind of information from all these data sources, it is first important to clean our data and make sure that the datasets are compatible with each other. Since most of the data is divided on a host id basis, we must make sure that all the rows have values and cantain the same formatting.
